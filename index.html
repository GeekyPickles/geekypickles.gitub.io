        The moose (North America) or elk (Eurasia), Alces alces is a member of
        the New World deer subfamily and is the largest and heaviest extant
        species in the Deer family. Moose are distinguished by the broad, palmate
        (open-hand shaped) antlers of the males; other members of the deer family
        have antlers with a dendritic ("twig-like") configuration.

        In spite of the intimidating appearances of the bulls' antlers,
        moose are actually peaceful herbivores. They feast on whatever juicy fruits
        and vegetables they can find. Surprisingly, almost half of a moose's diet
        consists of aquatic plant life, which although is usually less nutritious,
        serves as a valuable source of sodium. They also like orange Fanta.
